I.  Introduction:

- - -

This is my second skin for the new VGUI of Steam.  I found that my old one was on the correct track, but seemed very lacking.  Rather than just making the changes to that old skin (the original "Steam 3.0 Source"), I decided to start from scratch.  I completely re-worked the default Steam 3.0 skin, using what I liked from my old skin, and implementing it into this one.  It is very similar, but the details are amazingly different.  For instance, there are now shadows, highlights, and other such slight differences that really give this skin a 3D feeling, which was one of the things that the old skin lacked.  The buttons now look very aesthetically pleasing, and seem much more natural, like buttons should be.  It also uses the VALVe World Icon Pack, created by Vaksa (http://vaksa.deviantart.com/).  I take no credit for these icons, and hope that if you use them in your skin, that you will consult him first and also give him credit.  And I thank random_n for his continued support in my skinning, especially for his informing me of a method I can use to make the custom Goldsrc skin work with all of the applications that use it.  I had been experimenting around with how to do this, and he blessed me with a wonderful way to accomplish it.

II. Installation Instructions:

- - -

Unzip the contents of this archive (including the skins folder contained in this archive) into your Steam folder (usually "C:\Program Files\Valve\Steam\" or "C:\Program Files\Steam\").  This will not overwrite any other skins you currently have in you Skins folder.  To use the skin, open Steam, go to Settings, then to Interface, and then choose "Steam 3.0 Metal" from the drop-down menu.  You must restart Steam for the changes to fully take effect.

III.  Release Notes

- - -

This is a work in progress, as I may find things that I cannot reproduce (i.e. windows that only appear after Steam triggers something, not the user) that I would like to change, and I may find a different color scheme to be more to my liking.  I do not know of any bugs yet, but you are encouraged to contact me at rthaut@gmail.com if you find anything.

IV.  Terms of Use

- - -

Anyone and everyone is allowed to use this skin.  I ask, however, that you contact me first before making any changes to it that do not significantly change the entire skin.  Anyone and everyone has permission to modify and reproduce this skin, I only request that I know about it.  It is intended for people to use as a reference and learning tool, so that anyone can create new skins by using the things I learned and documented in the SteamScheme.res file.  The notes contained in that file are directed towards myself and anyone modifying/referencing it.

Also, if you redistribute the icons supplied in this skin, please first contact Vaksa before doing so.  They are a wonderful addition to any skin, and I am sure he would much like to know if anyone is using them in and/or redistributing them with their skin.  Give him credit as well, as it is the noble thing to do.

V.  Change Log

- - -

A.  December 27, 2005

- - -

- I have changed the disabled combo box's appearance, as I was unaware of the fact that it was actually used, which is when viewing the properties of a server.

B.  December 29, 2005

- - -

- I have renamed the files and folders to organize them better.  The changes are reflected in the SteamScheme.res file.
- I have changed the radio buttons; having never seen them before I omitted them to release the skin earlier, though I later realised they must serve some purpose, however infrequent and far between it may be.

c.  January 11, 2006

- - -

- I have fixed the wizard window (i.e. Activate a Product, Backup Games, etc.); a shadow was improperly rendered.
- I have adjusted the title bar to better fit with the skin.  It now looks like the whole thing goes together.
- I have created my own icons for the bottom bar on the Main Steam Window.  They make a nice addition, while balancing out the skin better.

D.  January 13, 2006

- I am including a custom skin that will be used in all non-source games (technically called the Goldsrc skin).  It matches the custom Steam VGUI very well, but it does have limitations.  As I learn more about this, as I have never skinned for it before, I will continue to make it more like the steam skin, and I will release updates for it.

E.  January 29, 2006

- - -

- I have changed the gradients on the skin to be more smooth.  I purchased a new monitor that has wonderful color and contrast, and the first thing that I noticed was that the old gradient was very ugly.
- I have fixed the appearance of the "Backup Wizard" to match the appearance of the rest of the skin.
- I have added Vaksa's Steam logo to the "About" page.  It looks natural, and adds more flavor to the skin.  I am hoping to implement this icon into the title bar as time goes on, although at first glance it looks to be a very difficult challenge, but I will look further into this.
- I have made a minor change to the scroll buttons to make them look more naturally rounded.  The technical difference is four pixels, although the scroll buttons no longer catch the eye as they did before.

F.  February 2, 2006

- - -

- I have changed the way text boxes are rendered so that the Friends windows work properly.
- I have changed the text input boxes to better match the skin, now that they will be used frequently when the Friends Network comes out of beta status and becomes public.

G.  February 6, 2006

- - -

- I have changed the appearance of the scrollbars once again.  I think this is the way that they will stay.  They now look like they are part of the window, rather than just an addition.
- I have changed the appearance of the buttons to make them less pixelated and more smooth.  The darks and lights no longer catch the eye and loose the flow created by the skin.
- I have changed the appearance of the folder tree when using the Backup Wizard to accomodate the changes made to the scrollbars.
- I have fixed the small icons in the folder tree (i.e. folder, up-folder, file, etc.).  They all have transparent backgrouns now, so that they do not stick out.
- I have changed the Friends icons to match the skin.  When Friends is removed from beta status and becomes public, all the changes made to its layout for my skin will be fully functional.

G.  January 8, 2007

- - -

- I have renamed the skin to "Steam 3.0 Metal" for two reasons: I have created a skin that much better fits the name "Steam 3.0 Source," and this skin has a very metallic look to it.
- I have updated the skin to be fully functional with the most recent version of Steam.
- I have updated the installation instructions to reflect the new distribution method I am using.
