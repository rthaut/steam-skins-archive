## Installation

How to replace the lower buttons (i.e. News, Friends, Servers, etc.):

1. Open the Slate skin folder (usually C:\Program Files\Steam\skins\Slate). If you are using Slate Colored, open the Slate Colored folder; the same goes for Slate Orange.
2. In this .zip archive there is a Buttons folder; move it into the skin folder you just opened. You must OVERWRITE the current Buttons folder and all of the files inside it.
3. Restart Steam to activate the changes.

NOTE: To undo this, there is a folder called Originals inside of the Buttons folder; move all of the files inside Originals into the Buttons folder (overwriting all files when prompted), and restart Steam to activate the changes.

Basically all you are doing is replacing the original images the make up the lower buttons with images that make the standard buttons. There is no renaming to be done, and no editing of any files.
