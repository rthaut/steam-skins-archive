I. Introduction:

- - -

This is my fourth skin for the new VGUI for Steam.  I made this because many people have requested over the past year or so, and because it was really simple, for the most part.  Granted it is not an exact replica of the actual Source Engine's GUI, but it is very close.  The Steam GUI does not handle transparency very well, so I couldn't make this skin transparent like the Source version.  Also, some of the dimensions are slightly different, but you can only notice this if you take screenshots and compare them carefully.  I chose not to make the dimensions the exact same for several reasons: I didn't want to infringe on VALVe's work, and by making an exact copy, I would be claiming their work as my own.  Also, in order for the skin to look good (aesthetically pleasing) in the Windows environment, some elements had to be slightly modified.  Again I am including Vaksa's (http://vaksa.deviantart.com) icons, which I have included with all of my other skins; everyone seems to like them more than the default ones, and he likes it when I link back to him. :)

II. Installation Instructions:

- - -

Unzip the contents of this archive (including the skins folder contained in this archive) into your Steam folder (usually "C:\Program Files\Valve\Steam\" or "C:\Program Files\Steam\").  This will not overwrite any other skins you currently have in you Skins folder.  To use the skin, open Steam, go to Settings, then to Interface, and then choose "Steam 3.0 Source" from the drop-down menu.  You must restart Steam for the changes to fully take effect.

III. Release Notes

- - -

This is a work in progress, as I may find things that I cannot reproduce (i.e. windows that only appear after Steam triggers something, not the user) that I would like to change, and I may find a different color scheme to be more to my liking.  I do not know of any bugs yet, but you are encouraged to contact me at rthaut@gmail.com if you find anything.

IV. Terms of Use

- - -

Anyone (and everyone) is allowed to use this skin.  I ask, however, that you contact me first before making any changes to it whether they significantly change the entire skin or not.  Anyone and everyone has permission to modify and reproduce this skin, I only request that I know about it.  It is intended for people to use as a reference and learning tool, so that anyone can create new skins by using the things I learned and documented in the SteamScheme.res file.

Also, if you redistribute the icons supplied in this skin, please first contact Vaksa before doing so.  They are a wonderful addition to any skin, and I am sure he would much like to know if anyone is using them in and/or redistributing them with their skin.  Give him credit as well, as it is the noble thing to do.
